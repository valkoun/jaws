1) Upload all files to your server in the http root or web accessable folder.

2) If you want surfers to save banners on your server, create a save folder, the class assumes a 
folder name of /save. Change permissions to 777 (rwxrwxrwx).

3) Create a fonts folder, the class assumes /fonts and expects to find Arial.ttf, Times.ttf and 
Verdana.ttf. Upload the true type fonts you wish to use into this folder and change the fonts variable
in the class to match these.

4) Make any setting changes to the makeban.class.php file

5) Point your browser to the makeban.php file and you are ready to create banners online.
